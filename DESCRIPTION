Description: A complete set of functions to calculate several EBLUP (Empirical Best Linear Unbiased Predictor) estimators and their mean squared errors. All estimators are based on an area-level linear mixed model introduced by Rao and Yu in 1994 (see documentation). The REML method is used for fitting this model.
